Here we are testing the vector unsigned multiplication instructions. They work on 64 bit data (we take input and ouput as a register pair).

vumuld8  - Both inputs are divided into 8 one byte values and then each multiplied, giving output as 8 one byte values.
vumuld16 - Both inputs are divided into 4 parts of 2 bytes each Output is will 4 two byte numbers.
vumuld32 - Both inputs are divide into two words, ouput will be two 32 bit numbers.
