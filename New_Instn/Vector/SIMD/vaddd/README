Here we are testing the vector add instructions. They work on 64 bit data (we take input and ouput as a register pair).

vaddd8  - Input is divided into 8bytes and then added indiviudally. The carry is not taken into consideration by next byte.
vaddd16 - Input is divided into 4 parts of 2 bytes each. These two bytes are addede individually.
vaddd32 - INput is divide into two words, added individually.
