This repository is divided imto four parts -  

   1. New Instructions - It contains test programs for all verifying newly developed 64 bit instructions
       This is further divided into into 5 parts -
    
             Arithmetic - It contains test codes for verifying arithmetic instructions ADDD, ADDDCC, SUBD, SUBDCC.
             Logical    - Test codes for ORD, ANDD, XORD and their negate and conditional instructions also.
             Mul_Div    - Test codes for UMULD, SMULD, UDIVD, SDIVD nad their conditional instructions also.
             Shift      - Test codes for SLLD, SRLD, SRAD, in register and immediate format.
             Vector     - Test codes fro all vector instrucrions, VADDD, VSUBD, VUMUL VSMULD, byte-reduce instructions 
                          and floating point vectoe instructions
 
    
  2. ABI              - Here we are using the SPARC ABI to call aseembly functions from c programs.
      It has been divided as-
            
            add - Code for addition of single precision floating point numbers.
