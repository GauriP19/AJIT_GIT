# AJIT_GIT
This repository is divided imto four parts -  

   1. New Instructions - It contains test programs for all verifying newly developed 64 bit instructions
       This is further divided into into 5 parts -
    
             Arithmetic - It contains test codes for verifying arithmetic instructions ADDD, ADDDCC, SUBD, SUBDCC.
             Logical    - Test codes for ORD, ANDD, XORD and their negate and conditional instructions also.
             Mul_Div    - Test codes for UMULD, SMULD, UDIVD, SDIVD nad their conditional instructions also.
             Shift      - Test codes for SLLD, SRLD, SRAD, in register and immediate format.
             Vector     - Test codes fro all vector instrucrions, VADDD, VSUBD, VUMUL VSMULD, byte-reduce instructions 
                          and floating point vectoe instructions
                          
   In each of the above folders, there is a README, giving all the all the instructions for which test code s are present in that specific folder. Also, in folders where test codes for a specific instructions are present, the explanation of the instruction is given in a README file.
 
    
  2. abi_codes             - Here we are using the SPARC ABI to call aseembly functions from c programs.
      It has been divided as-
            
            add           - Code for addition of two input argumnets.
            add_more_args - Code for addition of more than 7 input arguments.
            add_fp_num    - Code  for addition of two floating point input argument.
            more_float    - Code for more than 6 floating point input arguments.
